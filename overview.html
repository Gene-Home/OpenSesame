<h1>An introduction to openSESAME</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><b>How openSESAME works</b></li>
        <li ><b>a.</b> Raw CEL files are normalized to obtain gene-level expression measurements.
            Here, red and blue indicate genes with high or low levels of absolute expression, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>b.</b> Within each experiment, expression measurements for each gene are z-score
            normalized to produce relative expression levels.  Here, red and blue indicate high or
            low expression relative to the other samples in the experiment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>c.</b> Relative expression levels for all experiments are concatenated into a single file.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>d.</b> For each sample in each experiment, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test is performed
        between the relative expression values of the "up" and "down" gene sets defined by
        the query signature, yielding a signature association (SA) score that can be strongly
        positive (yellow), strongly negative (magenta), or intermediate (black).
        Samples with strong positive or negative SA scores exhibit the same or
        opposite pattern of coordinate differential gene expression, respectively,
        as the query signature.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>e.</b> Fisher exact and K-S tests are performed on each experiment to
            determine whether it is significantly enriched in samples with positive or
            negative SA scores.  In experiments with significant enrichment, the query signature
            is likely to be perturbed, and this perturbation may be correlated with an experimental
            condition or a biological phenotype.
        </li>

    </ul>
<ul>
    <li><b>Submitting a query</b></li>

    <li>An openSESAME query requires a gene expression signature comprised of two
        sets of gene identifiers: "up" and "down" genes (which are coordinately induced
        and repressed, respectively, in some experiment).  These identifiers can be gene
        symbols, Affymetrix probesets, or Entrez Gene or RefSeq IDs.  All identifiers
        should be of the same type.
    </li>
    <li>To enter a query signature, first give the query a name, and then type or paste
        the "up" and "down" identifiers into the corresponding boxes.  openSESAME will
        then report how many input identifiers it was able to translate to Entrez Gene IDs.
    </li>

    <li>Once the query is submitted, it will take up to several minutes for the results
        to appear on the openSESAME web server.  You will receive a message from openSESAME
        at your registered email address when the query is complete.
    </li>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><b>Viewing query results</b></li>

    <li>When a query is complete, clicking the VIEW QUERY RESULTS tab will
        provide links to two types of results: enrichment significance tests
        (nominal p values and FDR q values) and heat maps.
    </li>

    <li>Clicking the View link will bring up a table with all GEO series IDs,
        their titles, and their associated K-S and Fisher p and q values, sorted
        in ascending order by K-S q value.
    </li>

    <li>Clicking the heat map link will automatically download a PDF file that
        contains individual heatmaps (one per page) of all GEO series with
        no more than 300 samples and with K-S or Fisher q values less than 0.25.
        The genes (rows) are clustered within the "up" and "down" gene sets
        and each sample (column) is annotated with its GEO sample (GSM) ID
        and a color bar indicating its SA score (yellow = SA score of 3 or
        higher; magenta = SA score of -3 or lower; black = SA score of zero).
    </li>

</ul>
