    openSESAME (Search of Expression Signatures Across Many Experiments) is a tool 
    for using patterns of gene expression to discover relationships between experimental 
    conditions, diseases, or biological states. openSESAME is unique in that it identifies 
    connections between datasets based on expression patterns alone, without the need for 
    prior knowledge of experimental groups or phenotypes.

    This web server is an interface to allow the scientific community to perform openSESAME 
    queries using a repository of over 75,000 Affymetrix human gene expression profiles obtained 
    from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 
    A gene expression signature (sets of genes that are expected to be coordinately induced or repressed) 
    is used as input. openSESAME will then return a list of datasets in which these genes are 
    coordinately differentially expressed, as well as plots (heat maps) of the expression of the 
    signature genes in these datasets. A more detailed description of how to perform and interpret an 
    openSESAME query is available after logging in.
